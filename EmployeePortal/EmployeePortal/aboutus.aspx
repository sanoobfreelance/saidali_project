          ClaySys was founded to deliver technology solutions that positively
          impacted the business, versus just technology solutions that were
          technically excellent, but may not have delivered on the key business
          objectives. We achieve this through a structured methodology that maps
          the business impact on every aspect of the technology solution being
          designed and developed. The core team at ClaySys are tenured IT
          Consultants who were involved in large scale technology projects
          starting from the early nineties. The innovative key-employee
          retention policies and incentives that we have structured ensure that
          our key employees stay with ClaySys for the long term, thus delivering
          incremental value to our clients, as we understand their business
          better. Our investments into product development to address some of
          the major holistic pain points related to software development and
          maintenance, keep us on the cutting edge of technology and well
          positioned to deliver exponential value to our clients.
